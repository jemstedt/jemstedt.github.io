This is a collection of a selection of projects I’ve worked on, professional and otherwise.

## Professional Projects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Expert Contribution – SOU 2024:81 ‘Ämneskunskaper och lärarskicklighet’](projects/expert_to_inquiry.qmd)

Contributed as an expert to the Swedish Ministry of Education's inquiry on improving teacher education using insights from cognitive science (SOU 2024:81).

### [A two-page study manual to improve self-regulated learning](projects/study_manual.qmd)

A study manual created for one of my research projects. The manual teaches evidence-based study techniques.

### [Free online course about evidence-based study techniques](projects/study_techniques_KTH.qmd)

As a postdoc at KTH, I created a free 30-minute online course on evidence-based study techniques using question-based learning.

### [AI tools that generate multiple-choice questions with feedback](projects/MCQ_generators.qmd)

I created ChatGPT tools at Stockholm University to help teachers generate feedback-rich quizzes that support student self-regulated learning.

### [One-page courses teachning topics the science of learning](projects/one_page_courses.qmd)
I've written a couple of Substack articles covering topics related to cognitive science and learning.

## Other Projects

Sometimes I make things just to try something out or learn a new tool. Not everything fits neatly into a category, but I enjoy side projects that blend data, writing, design, or psychology.

### [Stochastic Clock](projects/stochastic_clock.qmd)

Have you ever wished life was less predictable? As we grow older, uncertainty seeps out of our days, draining away the surprise and diminishing the thrill of each moment. Routine takes hold, and before you know it, excitement has quietly slipped through the cracks.

To recapture a bit of that lost uncertainty, I spent two evenings building a “stochastic” clock. Over the long run it will tell the right time on average, but most of the time it won’t. And the longer you let it run, the more likely you are to drift into your own private time zone (a phenomenon I call stochastic drift). Use my clock, and life will feel a little less certain, and perhaps a little more alive, though not necessarily any better.
