title: "MCQ Generators"
---

As part of a project at Stockholm university, I developed a ChatGPT GPTs that helps teachers generate large amounts of multiple-choice questions with feedback for each response alternative. The aim of the project is to develop tools to make it easier for teachers aid their students self-regulated learning by providing them with high-quality study materials before and after their lectures, seminars and workshops.

The GPTs have slightly different flavor and flexibility (how much it asks you to provide info about your topic). I am still working on ways of making the GPTs create harder and more high-quality questions.
