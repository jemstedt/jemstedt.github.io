## Note about mandatory work

If I have to do it, see if there is a way to make it fun.

## How to deal with situations where offers happen face-to-face or over phone

1. Say: **“Can I think about it and get back to you?”**

2. Consult this checklist.

3. If I answer on the spot, that answer is **provisional** — I’m allowed to change my mind after reviewing this. Think it through, its better to be a bit annoying and retract a yes than to end up regretting accepting a project.

***
### Pre-Mortem check (30 seconds) Imagine you've started working on the project and it went badly.

1. What went wrong?

2. Why did I end up regretting this?

3. Which part annoyed, stressed, or drained me more than expected?

4. Can I avoid or limit the bad parts?

If the likely failure feels obvious or familiar, treat that as real data, not pessimism.

### Acceptance Checklist
Only say yes if **all** of the following are true:

- [ ] **Meaningful progress**  
  There’s a substantial chance (≈50% or higher) that this will move me in a concrete way toward one of my [[Personal goals]]
- [ ] **Worth the cost**  
  The value clearly outweighs the pain, effort, or annoyance.
- [ ] **Capacity**  
  I genuinely have time for this without adding too much stress.
- [ ] **Opportunity cost**  
  This won’t crowd out something important that I already know I want to do.
- [ ] **Clean yes**  
  I’m saying yes because I want to, not out of guilt, fear, obligation, or people-pleasing.

If any item is a **no** or a **maybe**, the default answer is **no** (or **“not right now”**).
