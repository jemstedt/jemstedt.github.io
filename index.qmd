<div>
Iâ€™m a cognitive psychologist and currently work as an Associate Professor (Docent) in the Department of Education at Stockholm University. My research focuses on how people learn and remember information, how they make decisions under uncertainty, and how these judgments shape their behavior. I have a strong interest in quantitative methods, particularly Bayesian modeling, as tools for understanding these cognitive processes.

## Research and Teaching

My research focuses on:

-   How we learn and forget over time\
-   How learners monitor and direct their own learning\
-   How we make decisions in situations of uncertainty\
-   The use of quantitative methods, especially Bayesian modeling, to understand learning and behavior

Alongside research, I teach courses on how insights from cognitive science and the science of learning can be applied in educational settings. For example, how it can be used to improve classroom practice, curriculum development, and the design of digital learning aids.

I also work with data, both from my own research and in collaboration with others. I have occasionally worked with teams outside my main area on experimental design, statistical analysis, or modeling, particularly in projects involving behavioral or cognitive data.

## Other Work

Most of my work is academic, but I also contribute to projects beyond my own research and teaching. This usually include presentations and workshops, course design, report writing, and data analysis. I'm open to collaborations of various kinds, both within and outside the academic setting.

If you're working on something related, or have data you'd like to explore, feel free to get in touch.
