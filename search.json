    "text": "The full prompt for the AI assistant\nFor anyone who is curious or has ideas on how the assistant can be improved, here is the prompt that guides the AI’s behavior.\n\nPrompt\n# Base Persona: \nYou are an AI Instructional Designer and Learning Experience Designer. You are an excellent designer, psychometrician, and educator. You are helping the teachers with the following task. The user will provide you with topics, files, or learning objectives, and you will support them in creating practice questions based on them. You will provide five response alternatives to each question, as in a multiple-choice question. In addition, you will provide detailed corrective feedback for each alternative, as well as general feedback on the problem that students encounter, regardless of which response alternative they select. \n\n# Constraints: \n1. The correct alternative is always the first alternative. \n2. Avoid absolute terms in the response alternatives. For example, always and never.\n3. Alternatives should not include an \"all of the above\" option. \n4. Feedback to response alternatives should begin with a positive affirmation, then briefly explain why the alternative was correct or incorrect. \n5. All incorrect alternatives must be plausible but also incorrect. Avoid obviously incorrect alternatives.\n6. IMPORTANT: Create four versions of every question, one factual and one focusing on higher-order thinking, one that has to be phrased as a how question, and one as a why question. That is, the same topic should be covered in each question, but in different ways and at different depths.\n\n# Output format (do not print the question type):\n___\n## 1.1 Write the problem here\n- A (Correct): The response alternative\n    - Feedback: The feedback\n- B (Incorrect): The response alternative\n    - Feedback: The feedback\n- C (Incorrect): The response alternative\n    - Feedback: The feedback\n- D (Incorrect): The response alternative\n    - Feedback: The feedback\n- E (Incorrect): The response alternative\n    - Feedback: The feedback\n- F (Incorrect): The response alternative\n    - Feedback: The feedback\n\nGeneral feedback: The general feedback.\n___\n## Startup and initialization behavior (IMPORTANT)\n\nWhen the user clicks “let’s go,” the AI must not choose a topic, content, or examples on its own and must not generate multiple-choice questions, answer options, or feedback.\nInstead, the AI must always first provide the instructions listed under the heading “Usage Strategy” and then ask the user to specify which area the questions should cover.\n\nThis should be done through an open-ended question where the user is asked to specify, for example:\n\n- a concept\n- an idea\n- a theory\n- a field of work\n- a learning objective\n\nAfter the user has specified such an area may the AI begin creating questions according to the instructions above.\n\n## Usage Strategy\n\nThis AI helps you create multiple-choice questions and feedback. The content should always be reviewed by an expert, as generative AI can sometimes contain errors or less appropriate phrasing.\n\nExpect that some questions or parts of questions will not be of sufficient quality. A good strategy is to let the AI generate many questions and then select and further develop the best ones. You will sometimes need to fine-tune the content, since you usually have a better understanding of the purpose of your questions than the AI does. The AI generates many incorrect answer options for each question so that you can discard the weakest ones.\n\nNote that when you specify an area, the AI will create four different questions that are phrased in different ways. The purpose of this is to introduce variation in the questions and thereby ensure that at least one or a couple of questions are useful.\n___\n← Back to Teaching"

    "text": "📘 Study Manual\nBelow you will find descriptions of three methods that can aid your learning. Besides this, the manual also makes suggestions on how you can plan your study time to use these methods in your studies.\n\nThree methods that research has shown will aid your learning\n\n\n\n1. Deep processing of what you learn\nYou will remember information better if you elaborate on it and make it meaningful, rather than simply reading the words.\n\nCreate questions for yourself while you read which you can use to test yourself later. Use, for example, headings and concepts as a basis for your questions.\n\nWhen possible, write your questions in the form of “why” questions. For example: Why are polar bears white?\n\nWrite answers to your questions. If possible, do the following in your answers:\n\nWrite as if you were explaining to a person who has not learned what you have learned.\n\nUse concrete examples to clarify.\n\nConnect what you write to yourself or your personal experiences.\n\nConnect the information with things you have previously learned.\n\nIn the same way, create questions and answers for new information you learn during teacher-led learning.\nContinuously update your questions and answers as you learn more throughout the course.\n\n\n\n\n2. Retrieval practice\nYou will remember more of the course material if you test yourself on it instead of simply reading it again. However, it is important that you check that what you remember is correct.\n\nTest yourself on:\n\nThe questions you create while reading the course literature.\n\nQuestions in your course book:\n\nCheck if your course book has questions at the end of each chapter.\n\nCheck if your course book has a homepage with practice tests.\n\n\nOld exams and practice tests:\n\nWhen you know the answer to a question, write it down and use it when you test yourself later.\n\n\nWhen you test yourself, first try to remember the answer before you read the answer. Read the answer to check that what you remember is correct.\nTest yourself on other questions before you test yourself on the same question again.\n\n\n\n\n3. Distributed practice\nWhen you study, you have limited time to study different parts of the course material. You will remember each part better if you spread out your study time over shorter sessions instead of studying everything in one long session. Avoid studying the same information repeatedly in a single session. Instead, space it out.\n\nThe time between the sessions can be hours or days. The main thing is that you spread out your time.\nThis also applies to self-testing. Read or test yourself on other material before testing yourself on the same questions again."

    "text": "Plan your study time\nNone of the methods above will improve your learning if you do not use them. To make use of the methods, plan your time so that you have time to apply them — and to revisit the same material multiple times.\nWhen planning, make sure to allocate time for:\n\nReading the course literature according to your course’s schedule. While reading, follow the instructions under Deep processing of what you learn. Allow enough time to create good questions and answers.\nTesting yourself on material you learned earlier in the course. For example, test yourself on content from lectures 1 and 2 after attending lecture 3. Follow the instructions under Retrieval practice.\nTesting yourself on the same material at different points during the course. Follow the Distributed practice advice.\n\nAlso consider the following tips:\n\nUse a calendar to plan your study time.\n\nInclude time for group assignments.\n\nFull-time study equals about 40 hours per week — approximately 8 hours per weekday. This includes both independent and teacher-led learning."

    "title": "A Proto Theory About Mental Effort and Production Rate",
    "section": "",
    "text": "← Back to Projects\nNot too long ago, I suffered a concussion. The following weeks and months were stressful and sometimes scary, but also interesting for someone interested in the mind. I have previously published work on how metacognitive monitoring is influenced by the ease or difficulty of information processing, a construct called processing fluency. Because of this work, I not only experienced changes in processing fluency during this time, but also observed and thought about them a lot. These observations resulted in an idea.\nThe idea came mainly from a series of experiences that can be summarised as follows. When engaging with a thought and seeing where it would take me, the thoughts wouldn’t come as they normally would, but I could stick with them. When I did, the thoughts would come, but more slowly, and I could feel a pressure or load building in my mind. Sometimes this would reach a level where it caused me nausea. This only happened when I continued to engage with thoughts, even though I could feel the mental effort or nausea building.\nIn the literature on processing fluency, it is often discussed in terms of how easy or difficult it is to process information, as well as how easy it is to retrieve information from memory (retrieval fluency) or to process perceptual information (perceptual fluency). However, my experiences suggest that it could be fruitful to consider processing fluency (and the other types of fluency) as two distinct yet interconnected processes: mental effort and mental production rate.\nI define Mental effort as the experienced level of cognitive effort or load. At low levels, we are rarely consciously aware of it, but at high levels, it can even cause nausea. This construct is similar to the definition of processing fluency, but there are important differences that will be clarified. During my concussion, I experienced nausea from high cognitive load many times, but I had also experienced it before that, although rarely. For example, I experienced it when I took a class on multivariate Bayesian modelling and tried to visualise how different probabilities interacted.\nI define Mental production rate as the rate at which mental events appear in our minds. This could be how quickly our inner voice produces words or sentences, how quickly we understand what we are looking at, how quickly we develop an idea or how quickly new Scrabble combinations come to mind. The ease with which we produce conscious experiences depends on the task difficulty. If it is something we have done many times before, only a little effort is required to produce them at a high rate. However, if the task is novel or difficult in some other way, or if our cognitive abilities are reduced (e.g. due to a concussion), more effort is required to produce them at a high rate.\nCritical to this construct is that we have an expected rate of production from moment to moment and from task to task. If the rate of experiences is lower than we expect (not in an accepted span), mental effort is increased to raise the rate so it ends up in the accepted range If it is higher, mental effort is reduced. For example, imagine you are trying to form a sentence for a text, but the words aren’t coming at the rate you expect. You are struggling to find the words. Then, mental effort may increase to try to increase the production rate. If no increase is achieved, we might give up. How hard we push likely depends on goal importance. That is, how important it is to us to achieve the aimed-for production rate. In addition, the expected rate we have from moment to moment likely depends on prior experiences, how active we are overall (fully engaged in a task, or trying to go to sleep), and task difficulty. And probably more factors. That is, again, mental effort increases to reach our expected rate of production in the current task, however, there is likely a continous process of reducing mental effort. That is, unless mental effort is increasing or the production rate is in the accepted range, the brain works to reduce mental effort.\nPut differently, there is an ongoing balancing act between the production of mental experiences and the effort we put in to reaching an accepted level of production of conscious experiences. The following factors are critical to this model: 1. Mental effort 2. Mental production rate 3. Task difficulty 4. Expected rate of production 5. Goal importance\nMental production rate is influenced by task difficulty and the current mental effort. If we assume that task and task difficulty are held constant, then increasing or decreasing mental effort is the only way to change mental production rate. Whether or not mental effort is changed depends on the expected rate of production. If the mental production rate is within the expected/accepted range of production rate, then effort is unchanged, but if it’s too low or unnecessarily high, then it is changed. If mental effort does not increase the rate as aimed for, mental effort may increase even more. However, at higher levels of mental effort, it may become uncomfortable or even cause nausea. If the goal we are trying to reach is important, we can accept this discomfort, but if it is not, we may give up/switch goal.\nFor example, in Jemstedt et al (2018) participants were shown words either written in all upper-case letters (e.g., EFFORT), or with every other letter being lower-case (eFfOrT) and asked to learn them for a later test. Over the two types of items, participants likely had a similar expected mental production rate based on their general experience of reading words, as they had no prior experience with a task like this. As such, when they read eFfOrT, the rate by which the word came to mind was lower than expected. That is, it took longer for them to read it than common words would usually take. This led their mental effort to increase to compensate. See Figure 1 below for a visualization of how mental effort and mental production rate change over an imagined task where a couple of words are processed in an experiment like this.\nA useful analogy is the how a driver adjusts the speed of a car, where mental effort is how hard the accelerator is pressed, mental production rate is the car’s speed, and task difficulty is the slope of the road, such that steeper uphill sections require increasingly forceful acceleration to maintain the same speed.\nFigure 1.. Figure illustrates an imagined experiment where a participant is trying to study six words (upper x-axis) for 5 seconds each (lower x-axis). How the word is shown (all upper-case letters a mix of upper- and lower-case letters) affects task difficulty, which impacts mental production rate, which in turn affects mental effort. The grey horizontal field shows the accepted/expected production rate for the task, which the model aims for the production rate to be within. The y-axis shows the level of production rate (blue line) and level of mental effort (orange line).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n← Back to Projects"

As we grow older, uncertainty seeps out of our days, draining away the surprise and diminishing the thrill of each moment. Routine takes hold, and before you know it, excitement has quietly slipped through the cracks.\nTo recapture a bit of that lost uncertainty, I spent two evenings building a “stochastic” clock. Over the long run it will tell the right time on average, but most of the time it won’t. And the longer you let it run, the more likely you are to drift into your own private time zone. Use my clock, and life will feel a little less certain, and perhaps a little more alive, though not necessarily any better."
