As we grow older, uncertainty seeps out of our days, draining away the surprise and diminishing the thrill of each moment. Routine takes hold, and before you know it, excitement has quietly slipped through the cracks.\nTo recapture a bit of that lost uncertainty, I spent two evenings building a ‚Äústochastic‚Äù clock. Over the long run it will tell the right time on average, but most of the time it won‚Äôt. And the longer you let it run, the more likely you are to drift into your own private time zone (a phenomenon I call stochastic‚ÄØdrift).

    "text": "üìò Study Manual\nBelow you will find descriptions of three methods that can aid your learning. Besides this, the manual also makes suggestions on how you can plan your study time to use these methods in your studies.\n\nThree methods that research has shown will aid your learning\n\n\n\n1. Deep processing of what you learn\nYou will remember information better if you elaborate on it and make it meaningful, rather than simply reading the words.\n\nCreate questions for yourself while you read which you can use to test yourself later. Use, for example, headings and concepts as a basis for your questions.\n\nWhen possible, write your questions in the form of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù questions. For example: Why are polar bears white?\n\nWrite answers to your questions. If possible, do the following in your answers:\n\nWrite as if you were explaining to a person who has not learned what you have learned.\n\nUse concrete examples to clarify.\n\nConnect what you write to yourself or your personal experiences.\n\nConnect the information with things you have previously learned.\n\nIn the same way, create questions and answers for new information you learn during teacher-led learning.\nContinuously update your questions and answers as you learn more throughout the course.\n\n\n\n\n2. Retrieval practice\nYou will remember more of the course material if you test yourself on it instead of simply reading it again. However, it is important that you check that what you remember is correct.\n\nTest yourself on:\n\nThe questions you create while reading the course literature.\n\nQuestions in your course book:\n\nCheck if your course book has questions at the end of each chapter.\n\nCheck if your course book has a homepage with practice tests.\n\n\nOld exams and practice tests:\n\nWhen you know the answer to a question, write it down and use it when you test yourself later.\n\n\nWhen you test yourself, first try to remember the answer before you read the answer. Read the answer to check that what you remember is correct.\nTest yourself on other questions before you test yourself on the same question again.\n\n\n\n\n3. Distributed practice\nWhen you study, you have limited time to study different parts of the course material. You will remember each part better if you spread out your study time over shorter sessions instead of studying everything in one long session. Avoid studying the same information repeatedly in a single session. Instead, space it out.\n\nThe time between the sessions can be hours or days. The main thing is that you spread out your time.\nThis also applies to self-testing. Read or test yourself on other material before testing yourself on the same questions again."

To make use of the methods, plan your time so that you have time to apply them ‚Äî and to revisit the same material multiple times.\nWhen planning, make sure to allocate time for:\n\nReading the course literature according to your course‚Äôs schedule. While reading, follow the instructions under Deep processing of what you learn. Allow enough time to create good questions and answers.\nTesting yourself on material you learned earlier in the course. For example, test yourself on content from lectures 1 and 2 after attending lecture 3. Follow the instructions under Retrieval practice.\nTesting yourself on the same material at different points during the course. Follow the Distributed practice advice.\n\nAlso consider the following tips:\n\nUse a calendar to plan your study time.\n\nInclude time for group assignments.\n\nFull-time study equals about 40 hours per week ‚Äî approximately 8 hours per weekday. This includes both independent and teacher-led learning."
